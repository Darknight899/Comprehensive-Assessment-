# BMI prediction: Linear Regression Analysis
Project goal: To predict BMI (index) using features height, weight, and gender.
The data set used and explored was retrived from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/bmidataset?resource=download, n=500. In the preprocessing phase, I encoded feature gender (male and female) to 1 & 0 respectfully, along with the standardization of the data set. Using Linear regression is a simple model yet simple models can be extremly useful and telling. For example, in this model, the mean squared error (MSE) return a value of 0.32, which is fairly weak, but if we look at the coefficients we understand why. Weight's coefficient (1.09) is twice as strong and impactful as height (-0.57) meaning an increase in 1 standard deviation in weight increases BMI (index) 1.09 units. This makes logical sense, heavier people have a higher BMI. However, contrary to some beliefs, gender coefficient (0.01), as no impact on the model. I assumed a linear relationship between index (y) and the independent features height (x), weight (x), and gender (x). Thus, we can predict that those who are heavier is consistent with a higher BMI. Moving forward, it would interesting to train a polynomial regression to investigate non-linear relationships and compare results with the linear regression model.
